# Phase 2 Project

## Project Overview

In order to unravel the intricate influences on home or property values in King County, Washington, the United States, over the years 2014â€“2015, this research offers a practical investigation of multiple regression modelling techniques. The collection includes different property attributes and 21,597 real estate transactions. Although some features were not employed, a careful feature selection process was carried out to enhance the predictive model. To better comprehend the King County real estate market, the main goals include gaining insights, offering decision support, and strengthening data science skills.

### The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions about what the data means.


### Business Problem
The initiative attempts to solve the conundrum of unravelling the complex variables influencing real estate prices in the tumultuous King County real estate market. It attempts to equip purchasers, builders, and investors with useful insights. Regression research has revealed several important influencing factors, including living area, waterfront views, property condition, grade, and year of construction. In order to help stakeholders confidently traverse the market and make wise investment decisions, the project aims to develop a comprehensive "King County Real Estate Pricing and Investment Advisor" model.
